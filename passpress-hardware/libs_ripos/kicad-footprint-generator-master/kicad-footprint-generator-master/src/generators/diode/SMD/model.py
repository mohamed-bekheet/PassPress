# Dimensions are from Microchips Packaging Specification document:
# DS00000049BY. Body drawing is the same as QFP generator#
#
## Requirements
## CadQuery 2.1 commit e00ac83f98354b9d55e6c57b9bb471cdf73d0e96 or newer
## https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery
#
## To run the script just do: ./generator.py --output_dir [output_directory]
## e.g. ./generator.py --output_dir /tmp
