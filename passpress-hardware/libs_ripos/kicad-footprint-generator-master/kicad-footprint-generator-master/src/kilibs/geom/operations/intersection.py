    r"""Intersect two shapes.

    Args:
        shape1: One of the 2 shapes to intersect.
        shape2: The other shape to intersect with the first one.
        min_segment_length: The minimum length of a segment. If a segment resulting
            from the `intersect()` operation is shorter than `min_segment_length`, it is
            omitted from the resulting shape.
        tol: Tolerance used to determine if the two points are equal.

    Returns:
        A list containing a polygon or compound polygon (if there are arcs in the
        resulting shape) describing the outline of the intersection of the two shapes.
        If the intersection area is composed of multiple, disconnected regions (e.g., if
        one or both input shapes are concave), the list will contain one resulting shape
        for each region.

    Example:
        When `intersect()` is called with two rounded rectangles as argument:

    .. aafig::
        /--------------\
        |              |
        |        /-----+-----\
        |        |     |     |
        \--------+-----/     |
                 |           |
                 |           |
                 \-----------/

    The result would be:

    .. aafig::
                 /-----+
                 |     |
                 +-----/
